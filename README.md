In addition to the Revenue analysis dashboard, the Power BI and Excel solution I prepared for Atliq provides insights into various other important metrics:

Average Rating: This metric gauges the overall customer satisfaction by calculating the average rating received on the website. It helps Atliq understand the quality of their services and identify areas for improvement based on customer feedback.
Revenue by City: This component of the dashboard allows Atliq to analyze revenue generated in different cities where their properties are located. It provides visibility into the performance of each city, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, marketing strategies, and expansion opportunities.
Revenue by Room Class: Atliq can evaluate the revenue generated by different room classes (e.g., standard, deluxe, suite) using this visualization. This information assists in understanding the popularity and profitability of each room class, optimizing pricing strategies, and identifying potential upselling opportunities.
Revenue by Property: By analyzing revenue generated by each property, Atliq can identify the best-performing properties and focus on maximizing their potential. 
It also helps in assessing the performance of newly acquired or underperforming properties and taking necessary actions to improve their revenue generation.
Occupancy %: This metric provides a quick overview of the occupancy rate across all properties. It helps Atliq track the utilization of their rooms, monitor trends, and identify periods of high or low demand. This information is valuable for forecasting, staffing, and optimizing room availability.
Cancellation %: Tracking the percentage of cancellations allows Atliq to assess the impact of cancellations on their revenue and occupancy rates. It helps in identifying patterns or specific properties with higher cancellation rates, enabling targeted strategies to minimize cancellations and improve overall revenue performance.
Realization %: Realization percentage measures the actual revenue achieved compared to the potential revenue based on room availability. By monitoring this metric, Atliq can identify revenue leakage and take corrective measures to maximize their revenue potential.

By combining these metrics with the Revenue analysis dashboard, Atliq gains a comprehensive understanding of their business performance, customer satisfaction, 
and revenue drivers. This information facilitates data-driven decision-making, supports strategic planning, and empowers Atliq to optimize their operations and maximizeÂ profitability.
